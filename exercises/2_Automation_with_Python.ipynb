    "# Automate the collection of data from network captures\n",
    "\n",
    "`Wireshark` and `thsark` alternative in Python is `pyshark`.  \n",
    "We could definitely play with it and avoid being bothered with subprocesses, but...  \n",
    "`pyshark` is way too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred solution for today is then going to be:\n",
    "- Calling bash subprocesses with the `subprocess` library\n",
    "- Which allows us to use `tshark` (or any other preferred network capture parsing tool)\n",
    "- We can even use `parallel` to make it quicker\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non exhaustive list of useful libraries to make our life easier\n",
    "\n",
    "#### argparse\n",
    "\n",
    "`argparse` is a powerful and easy-to-use command-line argument parser library for Python. It allows you to write code that can accept a variety of input options and arguments when the code is run from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PyMISP (obviously)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main point here is to use PyMISP to automatically encode the data into MISP Events, Attributes & Objects  \n",

    "#### Focus on a specific type of data\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy could be to focus on a specific type of data first, like the DNS requests, the HTTP connections, etc.  \n",
    "We can then add additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choose an output format\n",
    "\n",
    "`tshark` is able to display the packets of a netwrk capture in different formats.  \n",
    "There is for instance:\n",
    "    - `fields` -> content is displayed in a 'CSV like' format with each packet being a line of values separated by a certain separator (that we can specify in our `tshark` command)\n",
    "    - `json` -> each packet is displayed in a JSON blob\n",
    "    \n",
    "The next question after we chose our favorite output format is: Do we filter the fields to display (recommanded for the `fields` display) or keep everything available (OK if we use the `json` display)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of tshark command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tshark -T fields -E header=yes -E separator='|' -e ip.src -e ip.dst -e tcp.srcport -e tcp.dstport -e _ws.col.Protocol -e frame.time -o tcp.relative_sequence_numbers:FALSE -r data/2021-08-19-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap\n",

    "## Exercise steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1- Standard version\n",
    "\n",
    "With the first version implemented in `pcap2misp_v1.py`, we simply extract `network-connection` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is pretty straight forward:\n",
    "- Process the network capture file with `tshark`in a `subprocess` command\n",
    "- Loop through the packets displayed in the standard output and identify connections\n",
    "- The connections information is stored in a dictionary:\n",
    "  - The key is the tuple `(ip.src, ip.dst, tcp.srcport, tcp.dstport, *frame.protocols)`\n",
    "  - We store the timestamp of the first packet seen and the number of similar connections\n",
    "- We loop through dictionary and create a `network-connection` MISP object for each connection\n",
    "- We write the resulting MISP Event in an output file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2- Add the information of the input file in the MISP Event\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the standard script described right above, add in the resulting MISP Event:\n",
    "- the information of the network capture file\n",
    "  - -> a `file` MISP object\n",
    "  - it is recommanded to use the `FileObject` class from PyMISP\n",
    "- additional information of the metadata\n",
    "  - the `pcap-metadata` object template seems fine for this kind of data\n",
    "  - you can use the `capinfos` command-line tool to get the information\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3- Parse dns records from the packets\n",
    "\n",
    "Add either an option or as a default feature, the ability to parse the information of the DNS packets:\n",
    "- use the `dns-record` MISP object to describe the DNS information\n",
    "- to help you map the packets data with the object template, here is the list of fields to consider in a packet:\n",
    "  - dns\n",
    "  - dns.a\n",
    "  - dns.aaaa\n",
    "  - dns.cname\n",
    "  - dns.mx.mail_exchange\n",
    "  - dns.ns\n",
    "  - dns.ptr.domain_name\n",
    "  - dns.qry.name\n",
    "  - dns.soa.rname\n",
    "  - dns.spf\n",
    "  - dns.srv.name\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### 4- Extract HTTP requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of information we could find in our network captures is the HTTP requests.  \n",
    "- use the `http-request` MISP object to describe the HTTP requests\n",
    "- to help you map the packets data with the object template, here is a list of fields to consider in a packet:\n",
    "  - http\n",
    "  - http.content_type\n",
    "  - http.cookie\n",
    "  - http.host\n",
    "  - http.referer\n",
    "  - http.request.method\n",
    "  - http.request.uri\n",
    "  - http.user_agent\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5- Extract payloads\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to extract the payloads from the HTTP packets:\n",
    "- the field you are looking for is `http.\n",
    "- you can use the PyMISP helpers such as `make_binary_object` to generate MISP objects for you\n",
    "  - `make_binary_object` can take the payload's file name or the payload itself as bytes\n",
    "  - in order to pass the payload directly, encode it in a `BytesIO` object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6- (Bonus) Share the parsed and converted MISP data in the MISP instance of your choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the config file `MISP_config.json`, connect to your favourite MISP server and push the MISP Event you just created and populated with the parsed network capture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is mostly only one way to connect to the server using the `PyMISP` constructor, you can choose between 2 strategies to push your MISP data:\n",
    "- the straight forward and easier way: keep the event and objects declaration as they are and add the event at the end.\n",
    "- the trickier version: use from the beginning the `add_X` methods to let `pymisp` declare the event & objects and give you a pointer to the created structures.  \n",
    "  In this situation you need to make sure the data is directly synchronised with your instance or you have to update it at the end"
